# Personal Loan Campaign 
---
## Problem Statement & Objective
A bank wants to improve the acquisition of customers to their personal loan scheme from current customer database. The objective of the report is to build a model which can classify the right customers who have a  higher probability of purchasing the loan. Which segment should be targeted more and reflect upon the performance of the models and find the best model.

## Technologies

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - Pandas is included in Anaconda distribution and Conda package manager to manage Python environments.
- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) - web-based user interface designed for data analysis. It lets you write, run, and review the results in Python programs (all in a single integrated development environment (IDE).
- [The imbalanced-learn documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable) - mbalanced-learn (imported as imblearn) is an open source, MIT-licensed library relying on scikit-learn (imported as sklearn) and provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.
 - [The scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.
